\subsection{Assignments 6} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Files to rotate can be set by giving their path
\item Files can be rotated daily, weekly, monthly or yearly by adjusting the rotation interval parameter. The logs can also be rotated because of a set log file size
\item The rotate count paramater determines how many log files that should be kept before the oldest are deleted.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assignments 9} 
You are not able to compress the data by backing up the mysqldump from a remote machine. The user also needs quite a lot of permissions to perform the remote backup.\\
Performing the backup remotly might be easier to automate, depending on the setup.
